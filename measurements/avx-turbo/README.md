# Avx Turbo

The scripts in this folder allow us to run avx turbo on different number of cores.
The resulting plots indicate a mapping between license levels and the number of instructions executed.
(Compare `avx512_fma` with `avx512_fma_t`. The first one runs at one license level, while the later one runs at a different one.)
