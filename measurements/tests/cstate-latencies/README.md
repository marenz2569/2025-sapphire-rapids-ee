# Test for idle switch times
This is the test that checks how long it needs to wake up a core. The methodology was introduced and described in [1,2].

## Precondition
- GCC (can be changed in the measurement script)
- The `intel_idle` driver, as defined in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/current_driver`
- The `acpi_cpufreq` driver, as defined in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver`

## Scripts test/measure.sh
- gathers idle switch times for different combinations of frequency, idle state and placement of caller/callee


## Results
- have been tar-gz-ipped to test/out.perf.tar.gz to reduce file size.
- note: the resulting perf.data files have been converted using `perf script --ns` so that they will also be readable on other systems.

## Analysis
- use analyze/analyze.ipynb
