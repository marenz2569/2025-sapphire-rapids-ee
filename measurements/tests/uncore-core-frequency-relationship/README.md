# Test for Uncore frequency changes

These scripts in this folder test the uncore frequency behavior by evaluating the relationship between the core and uncore frequencies.

## Uncore - core frequency relationship

### Precondition

The `acpi_cpufreq` or `intel-cpufrq` drivers must be used for these tests. Please check `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver`. The script will terminate if another CPUFreq driver is used.
Access to `rdmsr` and `sudo` is assumed.
The script assumes an Intel Core i9-12900k. If you use a different CPU with different core counts and/or frequencies, the script must be adapted.

### Script test2/uncore_frequencies.sh

- Tests different permutations of core/uncore frequency pairings, including automatic frequency selection. For this purpose, the script will change the scheduling governor several times
- A `while(1);` workload is executed on one or more cores for a duration of 10 seconds
- C-states are enabled for all tests
- The core and uncore frequencies are measured at core 0 (p-core) and core 23 (e-core) using `perf stat` for the duration of the workload, with a sampling interval of 1 second

### Results

Results are presented in human readable output by the script. The configuration of each measurement is described in the output.

### Analysis

No additional steps for the analysis are required.
