% In addition to the performance of computer systems, energy efficiency is another relevant metric for their evaluation. In this thesis, the student analyzes the energy efficiency methods of the Intel Sapphire Rapids architecture and evaluates their effects on performance and power consumption. This includes an assessment of the power-saving mechanisms defined in the ACPI standard, as well as the integrated monitoring methods for power consumption.
