In this work we analyze the performance of these state-of-the-art CPUs and create an accurate in-core performance model for their microarchitectures Zen 4, Golden Cove, and Neoverse V2, extending the Open Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) tool and comparing it with LLVM-MCA. Starting from the peculiarities and up- and downsides of a single core, we extend our comparison by a variety of microbenchmarks and the capabilities of a full node. The "write-allocate (WA) evasion" feature, which can automatically reduce the memory traffic caused by write misses, receives special attention; we show that the Grace Superchip has a next-to-optimal implementation of WA evasion, and that the only way to avoid write allocates on Zen 4 is the explicit use of non-temporal stores.},

abstract = {The continuous evolution of processors requires vendors to translate ever-growing transistor budgets into performance improvements, e.g., by including more functional units, memory controllers, input/output (I/O) interfaces, graphics processing units (GPUs), and caches. This trend also increases complexity, which cannot be fully hidden from the operating system (OS) or application domains. Issues likewhere to place threads if cores have different frequency ranges or architectures, orwhere to perform a task that might be hardware-accelerated cannot be decided on a hardware level. Moreover, performance improvements need to be achieved within a limited power envelope with energy efficiency as a first order design goal. Introduced power saving techniques, however, can contradict OS and applications performance assumptions. Several processor vendors offer heterogeneous processor architectures, such as ARM's big.LITTLE or Apple M1, combining high-performance and power-efficient cores. Intel's first such architecture, Alder Lake, integrates different core architectures and various accelerating components. This work presents an architecture overview of Alder Lake and an in-depth analysis of its power efficiency properties and techniques. For example, this includes frequency scaling of different components, idle states and their latencies, integrated energy measurement capabilities, and recently introduced processor feedback interfaces and OS integration.},

abstract = {Measuring the energy consumption of software components is a major building block for generating models that allow for energy-aware scheduling, accounting and budgeting. Current measurement techniques focus on coarse-grained measurements of application or system events. However, fine grain adjustments in particular in the operating-system kernel and in application-level servers require power profiles at the level of a single software function. Until recently, this appeared to be impossible due to the lacking fine grain resolution and high costs of measurement equipment. In this paper we report on our experience in using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy sensors available in recent Intel CPUs for measuring energy consumption of short code paths. We investigate the granularity at which RAPL measurements can be performed and discuss practical obstacles that occur when performing these measurements on complex modern CPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the RAPL infrastructure to characterize the energy costs for decoding video slices.},

  abstract = {Modern processors, in particular within the server segment, integrate more cores with each generation. This increases their complexity in general, and that of the memory hierarchy in particular. Software executed on such processors can suffer from performance degradation when data is distributed disadvantageously over the available resources. To optimize data placement and access patterns, an in-depth analysis of the processor design and its implications for performance is necessary. This paper describes and experimentally evaluates the memory hierarchy of AMD EPYC Rome and Intel Xeon Cascade Lake SP server processors in detail. Their distinct microarchitectures cause different performance patterns for memory latencies, in particular for remote cache accesses. Our findings illustrate the complex NUMA properties and how data placement and cache coherence states impact access latencies to local and remote locations. This paper also compares theoretical and effective bandwidths for accessing data at the different memory levels and main memory bandwidth saturation at reduced core counts. The presented insight is a foundation for modeling performance of the given microarchitectures, which enables practical performance engineering of complex applications. Moreover, security research on side-channel attacks can also leverage the presented findings.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) has appeared as one of the most important techniques to reduce energy consumption in computing systems. The main idea exploited by DVFS controllers is to reduce the CPU frequency in memory-bound phases, usually significantly reducing the energy consumption. However, depending on the CPU model, transitions between CPU frequencies may imply varying delays. Such delays are often optimistically ignored in DVFS controllers, whereas their knowledge could enhance the quality of frequency setting decisions.The current article presents an experimental study on the measurement of frequency transition latencies. The measurement methodology is presented accompanied with evaluations on three Intel machines, reflecting three distinct micro-architectures. In overall, we show for our experimental setup that, while changing CPU frequency upward leads to higher transition delays, changing it downward leads to smaller or similar transition delays across the set of available frequencies.},

  abstract = {Power consumption has become a limiting factor in all areas of computing. Hence, making the most of the available power budget is paramount. To use the available budget most efficiently, techniques like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and idle states can be used. This work analyzes the instructions UMWAIT, TPAUSE, and MWAITX on three different systems. We analyze their instruction latencies, power consumptions, and dependencies on core frequencies. To do so, we introduce benchmarks to gather performance and power parameters, which can be used for future software optimizations. Key findings include: The expected sleep duration passed to UMWAIT and TPAUSE can influence the depth of the user idle state. The actual sleep duration of TPAUSE increases stepwise with an increasing expected sleep duration. Requesting a deeper idle state leads to an additional sleep duration, which increases with a lower core frequency. The core frequency influences the instruction latency of TPAUSE, where a low frequency can lead to an irregular performance pattern. The latency of TPAUSE, UMWAIT, and MWAITX is most often higher than requested on the evaluated systems. Core power consumption can be reduced by ~20\% ~70\% compared to the usage of PAUSE. The latency for waking a core in user idle reflects the underlying hardware architecture with tens (desktop architecture with shallow idle states) to hundreds (server architecture with deep idle states) of nanoseconds at nominal frequencies.},

abstract = {Rising energy consumption is of growing concern for cloud data center providers. Modern processors try to counteract this problem through low-power idle states that save energy in phases with little demand for compute resources. Making proper use of this feature, however, requires knowledge about the properties of these states for the very processors used in a specific setup; most importantly, the energy consumed in each idle state and the latency for resuming normal operation. Unfortunately, hardware vendors usually do not provide this critical information.In this paper, we propose a scheme for automatically analyzing the idle states of modern Intel processors. Our open-source implementation uses an extensible Linux kernel module to measure the energy and latency implications of a system's processor without any manual intervention or external equipment. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach by analyzing two Intel processors from the Haswell and Skylake generation ---an Intel Core i7-4790 and an Intel Core i7-6700K, respectively. The results show that our implementation yields reliable, precise, and reproducible measurements for the energy and latency implications of each processor's various idle states.},

abstract = {Unarbitrated contention over shared resources at different levels of the memory hierarchy represents a major source of temporal interference. Hardware manufacturers are increasingly more receptive to issues with temporal interference and are starting to propose concrete solutions to mitigate the problem. Intel Resource Director Technology (RDT) represents one such attempt. Given the wide adoption of Intel platforms, RDT features can be an invaluable asset for the consolidation of real-time systems on complex multi- and many-core machines. Unfortunately, to date, a systematic analysis of the capabilities introduced by the RDT framework has not yet been conducted. Moreover, no clear understanding has been matured about the implementation-specific behavior of RDT primitives across processor generations. And ultimately, the ability of RDT to provide real-time guarantees is yet to be established. In our work, we aim at conducting a systematic investigation of the RDT mechanisms from a real-time perspective. We experimentally evaluate the functionality and interpretability of RDT-aided allocation and monitoring controls across the two most recent processor generations. Our evaluations show that while some features like Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) yield promising results, the implementation of other primitives such as Memory Bandwidth Allocation (MBA) has much room for improvement. Moreover, in some cases, the presented interfaces range from blurry to incomplete, as is the case for MBA and Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM).},
