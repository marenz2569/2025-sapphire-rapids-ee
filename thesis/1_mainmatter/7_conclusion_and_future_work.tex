\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The claim of a specific IPC improvement can currently not be verified for specific small kernels.
    The data of Kobalicek~\cite{Kobalicek_AsmGrid} can be used to create a model of IPC improvement of specific instructions.
    More architectures can be added using Cult~\cite{Kobalicek_Cult} and the Asmjit Instruction Database~\cite{Kobalicek_InstructionDB}.
    This is also possible with the likwid bench toolkit~\cite{RHZE_HPC_likwid} for bigger compute kernels or with the data published by SPEC~\cite{spec} for bigger kernels and applications.
    \item ftalat measures time until frequency change
    \item uncore-frequency-switching-latency measures how long IO is blocked
    \item both measurement should be combined for both core and uncore latency classification
\end{itemize}
