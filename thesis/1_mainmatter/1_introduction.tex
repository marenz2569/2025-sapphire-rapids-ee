\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Highlight the importance of energy efficiency
    \item Show the two aspect of EE performance divided by power.
    \item performance is compared in memory hierarchy and core microarchitecture section
    \item energy efficiency is shown in power management section.
\end{itemize}

EE vs latency
EE vs power

In~\secref{background}, I discuss exsisting mechanisms to optimize energy efficiency and the evaluation thereof.
\secref{arch} describes the architecture of the Sapphire Rapids processor, introduces the test system and shows benchmarks of the core and uncore microarchitecture.
In~\secref{power_measurement}, I validate the accuracy of the power measurement which is used to facilitate some power management tasks, i.e. frequency throttling.
\secref{power_management} covers key metrics of exsisting power management mechanisms, i.e. turbo frequencies, frequency scaling and idle state latencies, and shows changes compared to previous processor generations.
I conclude with a summary and outlook in~\secref{summary}.
