\chapter{Architectural Details of ``Sapphire Rapids'' Processors}
The Sapphire Rapids family of Server Processors is the successor to the ``Ice Lake'' architecture.
It is the first in Intels lineup of server processor to introduce a modular design containing four tiles in a 2x2 grid interconnected with EMIB structures.
The two variants of this processor are 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processor and Xeon CPU Max Series with four additional HBM blocks.~\cite{Intel_2021_Hotchips}
Each tile contains up to 15 Golden Cove cores with a shared L3 cache connected by a mesh, accelerators, two DDR5 memory busses, N PCIe Gen 5 and one UPI 2.0 link.
This structure enables the package to be used in a single memory domain or split into two or four sub-NUMA clusters.~\cite{Intel_4th_gen_scalable}

Two mirrored tiles are arranged in a 2x2 grid, which are interconnected with EMIB structures to continue the mesh across the die boundaries.~\cite{Intel_2022_ISSCC}}
