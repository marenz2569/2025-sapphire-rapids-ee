\chapter{Architectural Details of ``Sapphire Rapids'' Processors}
The Sapphire Rapids family of Server Processors is the successor to the ``Ice Lake'' architecture.
It is the first in Intels lineup of server processor to introduce a modular design containing four dies in a 2x2 grid interconnected with EMIB structures.
The two varints of this processor are 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processor and Xeon CPU Max Series with four additional HBM blocks.~\cite{Intel_2021_Hotchips}
The processor support up to 60 Golden Cove cores, also used in the ``Alder Lake'' architecture, which have shared L3 cache interconnected with a mesh.
