\section{Shared Frequency Domains}
% measurements/shared-frequency-domains 
Core frequencies can have an impact on other cores as shown by Schöne et al. for cores on the Alder Lake Platform which has the same core micro-architecture as Sapphire Rappids~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.
To validate that core frequencies are independent of each other, I adopt the measurement scripts from Sch\"one et al~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.

For the measurement I disabled C-states, changed the cores to the lowest frequency (\SI{800}{\MHz}) and run a while true loop on one core.
The frequency of this core has been measured while another core is running with turbo frequencies, either idling or also running a while true loop.
It was repeated for all combinations of cores on a socket.
I could not detect any shared core frequency domains, this is consitent with the previous Intel generation Skylake-SP.

\section{AVX Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-frequencies}

Starting with the Haswell Microarchitecture, Intel introduced the concept of AVX frequencies.
This allows AVX2 instructions to use a lower base and different per core turbo frequencies~\cite{Hackenberg_2015_Haswell}.
The concept has been extended with a new class for AVX512 instructions with the Skylake Server Microarchitecture~\cite[Sec. 2.6.3]{Intel_Optimization_Reference_Manual_050}.
With the introduction of Ice Lake these classes are not only determined by the instruction set or register size, but a more realistic model of actual power consumption by also classifing instruction into ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' classes by their power consumption~\cite{papazian_new_2020}.
With the addition of the AMX instruction set Intel split up these classes further ranging from ``Ultra-Light'' to ``Heavy''.
The used instruction set together with the power consumption are mapped to four license levels which determine the opportunistic AVX turbo frequencies based on the number of active cores.
The mapping from instruction set and power usage are displayed in~\tabref{avx-classes}~\cite{ServeTheHome_Emerald_Rapids_2023}.
In \figref{p0n-frequencies} we are able to extracte the per core opportunistic turbo frequencies per license on our testsystem using a modified version of ``intel-speed-select''.

In~\cite{Downs_2020_AVX_Downclocking}, Downs measured the influence of AVX throttling on Ice Lake by infering the license level based on the resulting frequency of the ``avx-turbo'' microarchitectural benchmark.
However they were only able to trigger two out of the three license level, leaving open the question on how instructions are mapped to ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' classes.
Laukemann et al.~\cite{laukemann_microarchitectural_2024} showed the same for Sapphire Rapids using ``likwid-bench'' with the ``peakflops\_avx512\_fma'' and ``peakflops\_avx\_fma'' microarchitectural benchmark.
They were also only able to show two out of the four license levels.

\todoms{Show the license levels on SPR barnard (same processor as laukemann)}
To associate which events trigger the processor cores to be part of a license level, we design a microbenchmark that executes small kernels on a fixed number of threads and measure the resulting core frequencies.
This methodology is fundamentaly the same as demostrated by Downs and Laukemann et al.
However, we can only read the license level based on the maximal turbo frequency.
To ensure that we do not trigger other power limiting mechanisms, e.g. RAPL, we utilize ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' to set one thread to priority group zero and all other to priority group 1 with a fixed low maximum frequency.
The measurement of frequency is done on the thread in group zero, which should run at the maximum turbo frequency.
We will dissect ``Intel Speed Select'' in~\secref{isst}.

To validate the claim that the frequency limiting is independent of the ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' mechanisms, we prototype this measurement with four different FIRESTARTER kernels.
The result is displayed in~\figref{validated-p0n-frequencies}. We can clearly validate the findings of~\figref{p0n-frequencies}.

\section{AVX Frequency Anomalies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies}

To further test the effect of AVX frequency thottling mechanisms on the processor, I ran the same four FIRESTARTER workloads as described in~\secref{avx-frequencies} without the use of ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power''.
The measurement is repeated for different settings of the core, uncore frequency and two different workload population orders.

I discovered that firstly, throttling of the core frequency at \SI{800}{\MHz} with some AVX licenses, secondly that the reported AVX limits as described in~\figref{validated-p0n-frequencies} are worst-case limits and achieving higher turbo frequencies is possible.
The first effect is described in \secref{avx-anomalies-low-freq}, the second in \secref{avx-anomalies-model}.
I further found an anomaly in the uncore frequency selection which is described in \secref{avx-anomalies-uncore-freqency}.

\subsection{Throttling at Low Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-low-freq}

\todoms{describe the population order}
\todoms{Add uncore frequency as a new plot.}
The average core frequency is displayed in~\figref{avx-anomaly-core-frequency}.
% and the package power in~\figref{avx-anomaly-package-power}.
For core frequencies which are below the nominal frequency of \SI{2}{\GHz}, I expect that the frequency is met and not throttled.
This is also the case, expect for the AVX512 and AMX frequency levels at \SI{800}{\MHz} core frequency, which are throttled up to around \SI{600}{\MHz}.

\begin{figure}[]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/core-power-regulators-core-frequency.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:avx-anomaly-core-frequency}Average core frequency across the cores running the workload.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{AVX Frequency Model}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-model}

For higher than nominal frequencies the effect of RAPL is visible.
With increasing core count some workloads are thottled below the level shown in~\figref{p0n-frequencies}.
Strangly using a different pattern of populating the workloads on CPUs, we can archieve higher turbo frequencies outside of the limits shown in~\figref{p0n-frequencies}.
This shows that the opportunistic AVX frequencies and RAPL are two worst case models which are used for setting the core frequency, however other models in the CPUs power management are present that create this behaviour.
Further work is required to understand these in detail.

    one plot to support this claim. potential for optimization on intels side.
    sort of: turbo-mode (turbo ratio limit) is one of many algorithm.
    turbo-freq buckets are another. (garanteed turbo freqs in high prio buckets, vs low prio)
    perf-profile is yet another. (different TRLs (?) and base frequencies with different number of cores)
    core-power with CLOS groups are another. (different frequency limits based on different priorities)
    base-freq
    \item open question: how do they work together?
\end{itemize}

\section{P-State Latencies}

\todoms{Describe DVFS, latencies occur between switches, cite ftalat paper, schoene skylake and alderlake for comparison.}

To measure the latencies that occur during DVFS switches, I adapt ftalat, a benchmark developed by CITE PAPER, with modification by CITE PAPER.
ftalat measures the execution time of a compute loop with a fixed processor frequency.
The measurement methodology is as follows:
First, a frequency change is requested.
Second, the time until the execution time of the compute loop matches the expected for the requested frequency is measured.
Then the measurements waits a random time between \SI{0}{\us} and \SI{5000}{\us} before being repeated for \SI{1000}{} times.

In~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}, Schöne et al. demonstrated that the transition latencies for Alder Lake processors depend on the time since the last frequency transition.
In~\figref{pstate_latencies_time_dependance} we can observe this behaviour for frequency transitions from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.9}{}, \SI{2.0}{} and \SI{2.1}{\GHz}, whilst the transition latency from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.8}{\GHz} is unaffected by wait times.
We split the measurement data at a interval of \SI{1}{\ms} since the last frequency transition and plot the median latencies in~\figref{pstate_latencies_median}.
Below this interval the behaviour is the same as in Skylake-SP~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} with a higher latency of \SI{600}{\us} instead of \SI{500}{\us}.
Above this interval we see a different behaviour when switching to a higher frequency of \SI{1.9}{\GHz} and above.
Some source/target frequency pairs emit a higher transition latency, especially when switching to \SI{1.9}{\GHz} and \SI{2.0}{\GHz} from a lower frequency.
The expected worst case transition latency falls between \SI{1100}{\us} and \SI{2000}{\us}.
This can be read from the 99th percentile plot in~\figref{pstate_latencies_99percentQuantile}.
Outliers make this plot noiser than the other ones in this section.
