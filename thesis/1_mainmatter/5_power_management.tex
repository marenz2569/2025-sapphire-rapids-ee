\section{Shared Frequency Domains}
% measurements/shared-frequency-domains
Core frequencies can have an impact on other cores as shown by Schöne et al. for cores on the Alder Lake Platform which uses the same core micro-architecture as Sapphire Rappids~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.
To validate that core frequencies are independent of each other, I adopt the measurement scripts from Sch\"one et al~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.

For the measurement I disabled C-states, changed the cores to the lowest frequency (\SI{800}{\MHz}) and run a while true loop on one core.
The frequency of this core is measured while another core is running with turbo frequencies, either idling or also running a while true loop.
I repeated it for all combinations of cores on one socket.
No shared core frequency domains are detected, this is consitent with the previous Intel generation Skylake-SP.
\todoms{Check if I can cite the Skylake-SP here. There should be a reference in the software optimization guide.}

\section{AVX Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-frequencies}

Starting with the Haswell Microarchitecture, Intel introduced the concept of AVX frequencies.
This allows AVX2 instructions to use a lower base and different per core turbo frequencies~\cite{Hackenberg_2015_Haswell}.
The concept is extended with a new class for AVX512 instructions for the Skylake Server Microarchitecture~\cite[Sec. 2.6.3]{Intel_Optimization_Reference_Manual_050}.
With the introduction of Ice Lake these classes are not only determined by the instruction set or register size, but a more realistic model of actual power consumption by also classifing instruction into ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' $C_{dyn}$ classes\footnote{$C_{dyn}$ describes the dynamic capacitance of instruction which is proportional to the power consumption.} by their power consumption~\cite{papazian_new_2020}.
With the addition of the AMX instruction set Intel split up these classes further ranging from ``Ultra-Light'' to ``Heavy''.
Instructions are mapped mapped to four license levels based on their instruction set and power draw.
Opportunistic AVX turbo frequencies are determined based on the classes and number of active cores.
The mapping from instruction set and power usage are displayed in~\tabref{avx-classes}~\cite{ServeTheHome_Emerald_Rapids_2023}.
In \figref{p0n-frequencies} we are able to extracte the per core opportunistic turbo frequencies per license on our testsystem using a modified version of ``intel-speed-select''.

Downs~\cite{Downs_2020_AVX_Downclocking} measured the influence of AVX throttling on Ice Lake by infering the license level based on the resulting frequency of the ``avx-turbo'' microarchitectural benchmark.
However he was only able to trigger two out of the three license level, leaving open the question on how instructions are mapped to ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' classes.
Laukemann et al.~\cite{laukemann_microarchitectural_2024} showed the same for Sapphire Rapids using ``likwid-bench'' with the ``peakflops\_avx512\_fma'' and ``peakflops\_avx\_fma'' microarchitectural benchmark.
They were also only able to show two out of the four license levels.

To associate which events trigger the processor cores to be part of a license level, I designed a microbenchmark that executes small compute kernels on a fixed number of cores and measure the resulting core frequencies.
This methodology is fundamentaly the same as demostrated by Downs and Laukemann et al.
However, we can only read the license level based on the maximal turbo frequency.
To ensure that we do not trigger other power limiting mechanisms, e.g. RAPL, we utilize ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' to set one core to priority group zero and all other to priority group 1 with a fixed low maximum frequency.
This will priorize the power draw of the core in group zero over the others.
The frequency measurement is done on the core in group zero, which should run at the maximum turbo frequency.
``Intel Speed Select'' is described in more detail in~\secref{isst}.

To validate the claim that the frequency limiting is independent of the ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' mechanisms, we prototype this measurement with four different FIRESTARTER kernels.
Each kernel is executed for \SI{60}{\s} discarding the first \SI{30}{\s} and last \SI{5}{\s}.
The resulting opportunistic AVX frequencies are displayed in~\figref{validated-p0n-frequencies}.
We can clearly validate the findings of~\figref{p0n-frequencies}.

\section{AVX Frequency Anomalies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies}

To further test the effect of AVX frequency thottling mechanisms on the processor, I ran the same four FIRESTARTER workloads as described in~\secref{avx-frequencies} without the use of ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power''.
I discovered throttling of the core frequency some AVX licenses when it is set to \SI{800}{\MHz}.
This effect is described in~\secref{avx-anomalies-low-freq}.
I further found an anomaly in the uncore frequency selection which is described in~\secref{avx-anomalies-uncore-freqency}.

\subsection{Throttling at Low Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-low-freq}

Each FIRESTARTER kernel is executed for \SI{60}{\s} discarding the first and last \SI{5}{\s}.
I measure the uncore frequency by polling the associated MSR every \SI{10}{\ms} on CPU 0\footnote{\url{https://github.com/marenz2569/intel-uncore-freq-dumper}}.
The measurement is repeated on the cross product of following settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Core frequency set to \SI{800}{\MHz}, \SI{1600}{\MHz}, \SI{2000}{\MHz} and the default frequency range \SI{800}{\MHz}--\SI{3800}{\MHz}.
    \item Uncore frequency set to \SI{800}{\MHz}, \SI{1600}{\MHz}, \SI{2500}{\MHz} and the default frequency range \SI{800}{\MHz}--\SI{2500}{\MHz}.
\end{itemize}
\todoms{reference the appendix for all plots}

Since the FIRESTARTER kernels do not produce peak power draw, I expect that the core frequency not throttled below the nominal frequency of \SI{2}{\GHz}.
This is the case, expect for the AVX512 and AMX frequency levels at \SI{800}{\MHz} core frequency, which are throttled to just above \SI{550}{\MHz}.
This effect is shown in~\figref{avx-anomalies-low-freq}.
The severity of the effect depends on the selected uncore frequency and is worsend with a higher frequency.

    \caption{\label{fig:avx-anomalies-performance}Average core frequency across the cores running the workload with no limit on the core frequency resulting in a maximal turbo frequency of \SI{3800}{\MHz}.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Uncore Frequency Selection}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-uncore-freqency}

During testing I found that the selection of the uncore frequency is not deterministic for the AMX frequency level.
I ran the four described FIRESTARTER kernels \SI{100}{} times with ``Intel Speed Select'' disabled on CPU 0--7 with hyperthreading disabled.
CPU 8 run the uncore frequency measurement.
Each kernel is executed for \SI{20}{\s} discarding the first \SI{10}{\s} and last \SI{2}{\s}.
I expect the same performance and power draw across all runs.
However, two different levels of power draw with the kernels runnign at the AMX frequency level are visible in~\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-package-power-ecdf}.
This is caused by the uncore frequency selecting either \SI{1.4}{\GHz} for \SI{65}{\percent} and \SI{2.5}{\GHz} for \SI{35}{\percent} of the samples.
No major deviation of performance across the samples is observable, compare with~\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-mean-perf}.
\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-max-ee} show the resulting suboptimal energy efficiency reduction of more than \SI{25}{\percent} for the samples which caused a selection of the higher uncore frequency.
I also detected a reduction in energy efficiency for some samples of the SSE frequency license, however I could not associate this to a specific change with the metrics I measured.

\section{P-State Latencies}
\label{sec:pstate_latencies}

\todoms{Describe DVFS, latencies occur between switches, cite ftalat paper, schoene skylake and alderlake for comparison.}

To measure the latencies that occur during DVFS switches, I adapt ftalat, a benchmark developed by CITE PAPER, with modification by CITE PAPER.
ftalat measures the execution time of a compute loop with a fixed processor frequency.
The measurement methodology is as follows:
First, a frequency change is requested.
Second, the time until the execution time of the compute loop matches the expected for the requested frequency is measured.
The frequency is switched back and a random time between \SI{0}{\us} and \SI{20000}{\us} is waited before being repeated for \SI{4000}{} times.

In~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}, Schöne et al. demonstrated that the transition latencies for Alder Lake processors depend on the time since the last frequency transition.
I split the measurement data at a interval of \SI{1}{\ms} since the last frequency transition and plot the median latencies in~\figref{pstate_latencies_median}.
\todoms{Check}
Below this interval the behaviour is the same as in Skylake-SP~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} with a higher latency of \SI{600}{\us} instead of \SI{500}{\us}.
Above this interval we see a different behaviour when switching to a higher frequency of \SI{1.9}{\GHz} and above.
Latencies are generally higher in this area, with some samples showing a even higher transition latency.
In \figref{pstate_latencies_95percentQuantile} I display the 95th percentile plot for the transition latency.
This was chossen behause of many outliers probably caused by measurement noise and allow us to estimate the worst case transtion latency to between \SI{1100}{\us} and \SI{2000}{\us}.

The higher latencies depends on the time between the last frequency change, as shown in~\figref{pstate_latencies_time_dependance}.
The frequency transition from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.8}{\GHz} does not display any depdency between the latency and wait time between the transtion as expected from previous processor generations.
This is consitent with testing performed on a Skylake-SP system.
For frequency transitions from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.9}{\GHz} and above, we see two regions.
The first in the range of \SI{1000}{\us} and around \SI{1500}{\us}, emits the same behavour as explain above.
At around \SI{2000}{\us} we see a repeating pattern with a period of \SI{1625}{\us}, which intern contains samples which are not spread across the x-axis as previous, but are aligned with a period of \SI{200}{\us}.
Interestingly the number of samples which are above a transition latency of around \SI{900}{\us} decrease with an increase in frequency change.
Similar results have been reported by Schöne et al. for transition latencies of Alder Lake processors~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.
Furthermore, most samples do not align on a specific transition latency but are spread across a region of \SI{200}{\us}.
I conclude that for the region with the higher transtion latency the mechanisms as described by Schöne et al. is not applicable~\cite{skylake_paper}.
The power management seems to have an additional mechanisms that requies a frequency change to be finished at or before \SI{200}{\us}, if this is not possible that would result in another penaly of \SI{200}{\us}.
This could be linked to external power managment that has to increase the voltage for the specific core which could be bound to such period.
Further work is required to explain the cause of the high latencies for some frequency changes.
