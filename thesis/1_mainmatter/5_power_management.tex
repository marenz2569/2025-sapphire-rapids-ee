\chapter{Power Management}

Like its predecessors the Sapphire Rapids processor supports a variaty of different power management mechanisms.
Each core has its own on-die voltage regulator and therefore its own frequency domain as shown in~\secref{shared_freq_domains}.
\secref{avx-frequencies} describes the improved turbo frequency model that classifies instructions based on the power consumption.
The relation to the power allocation mechanism ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' is shown.
``Intel Speed Select'' is described in more detail in \secref{isst}.
\secref{avx-anomalies} shows two anomalies of core and uncore frequencies selection.
I describe the changes of frequency scaling for the core and uncore in~\secref{pstate_latencies} and \secref{uncore_frequency_scaling} respectively.
The wakeup latencies from idle states are presented in~\secref{idle_state_latencies} while I refer to Kuns et al.~\cite{Kuns_2025_UserSpaceIdle} for user space idle states.

\section{Shared Frequency Domains}
\label{sec:shared_freq_domains}
% measurements/shared-frequency-domains
Core frequencies can have an impact on other cores as shown by Sch√∂ne et al. for cores on the Alder Lake Platform which uses the same core micro-architecture as Sapphire Rappids~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.
To validate that core frequencies are independent of each other, I adopt the measurement scripts from Sch\"one et al~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}.

For the measurement I disabled hyperthreading, changed all cores to the lowest frequency (\SI{800}{\MHz}) and run a while true loop on one core.
The frequency of this core is measured while another core is running with turbo frequencies, either idling or also running a while true loop.
I repeated it for all combinations of cores on one socket.
No shared core frequency domains is detected.
This is consitent with the previous Intel generation Skylake-SP~\cite[Sec. 2.6.3]{Intel_Optimization_Reference_Manual_050}.

\section{AVX Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-frequencies}

Starting with the Haswell Microarchitecture, Intel introduced the concept of AVX frequencies.
This allows AVX2 instructions to use a lower base and different per core turbo frequencies~\cite{Hackenberg_2015_Haswell}.
The concept is extended with a new class for AVX512 instructions for the Skylake Server Microarchitecture~\cite[Sec. 2.6.3]{Intel_Optimization_Reference_Manual_050}.
With the introduction of Ice Lake these classes are not only determined by the instruction set or register size, but a more realistic model of actual power consumption by also classifing instruction into ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' $C_{dyn}$ classes\footnote{$C_{dyn}$ describes the dynamic capacitance of instruction which is proportional to the power consumption.} by their power consumption~\cite{papazian_new_2020}.
With the addition of the AMX instruction set Intel split up these classes further ranging from ``Ultra-Light'' to ``Heavy''.
Instructions are mapped mapped to four license levels based on their instruction set and power draw.
Opportunistic AVX turbo frequencies are determined based on the classes and number of active cores.
The mapping from instruction set and power usage are displayed in~\tabref{avx-classes}~\cite{ServeTheHome_Emerald_Rapids_2023}.
In \figref{p0n-frequencies} we are able to extracte the per core opportunistic turbo frequencies per license on our testsystem using a modified version of ``intel-speed-select''.

Downs~\cite{Downs_2020_AVX_Downclocking} measured the influence of AVX throttling on Ice Lake by infering the license level based on the resulting frequency of the ``avx-turbo'' microarchitectural benchmark~\cite{Downs_avx_turbo}.
However he was only able to trigger two out of the three license level, leaving open the question on how instructions are mapped to ``Light'' and ``Heavy'' classes.
Laukemann et al.~\cite{laukemann_microarchitectural_2024} showed the same for Sapphire Rapids using ``likwid-bench''~\cite{RHZE_HPC_likwid} with the ``peakflops\_avx512\_fma'' and ``peakflops\_avx\_fma'' microarchitectural benchmark.
They were also only able to show two out of the four license levels.

To associate which events trigger the processor cores to be part of a license level, I designed a microbenchmark that executes small compute kernels on a fixed number of cores and measure the resulting core frequencies.
This methodology is fundamentaly the same as demostrated by Downs and Laukemann et al.
However, as license level can only be validated using theri maximal turbo frequency,
I ensure that the RAPL power limiting mechanisms is not triggered.
Using ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' I can set one core to priority group zero and all other to priority group 1 with a fixed low maximum frequency of \SI{1600}{\MHz}.
This will priorize the power draw of the core in group zero over the others.
The frequency measurement is done on the core in group zero, which should run at the maximum turbo frequency.
``Intel Speed Select'' is described in more detail in~\secref{isst}.
I prototype this measurement with four different FIRESTARTER kernels.
Each kernel is executed for \SI{60}{\s} discarding the first \SI{30}{\s} and last \SI{5}{\s}.
Hyperthreading is disabled.
The resulting opportunistic AVX frequencies are displayed in~\figref{validated-p0n-frequencies}.
The findings of~\figref{p0n-frequencies} can clearly be validated.
This also highlights that frequency class dependent opportunistic core frequencies are independant of the ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power'' mechanism.

\end{figure}

\section{AVX Frequency Anomalies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies}

To further test the effects of AVX frequency thottling mechanisms on the processor, I ran the same four FIRESTARTER workloads as described in~\secref{avx-frequencies} without the use of ``Intel Speed Select Core-Power''.
In~\secref{avx-anomalies-low-freq} I discovered throttling of the core frequency at its lowest frequency (\SI{800}{\MHz}) when running with the AMX or AVX512 frequency level.
In~\secref{avx-anomalies-uncore-freqency} I describe an anomaly in the uncore frequency selection causing suboptimal energy efficiency for the AMX frequency level.

\subsection{Throttling at Low Frequencies}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-low-freq}

Each FIRESTARTER kernel is executed for \SI{60}{\s} discarding the first and last \SI{5}{\s}.
I measure the uncore frequency by polling the associated model specific register\footnote{UNCORE\_RATIO\_LIMIT} every \SI{10}{\ms} on CPU 0\footnote{\url{https://github.com/marenz2569/intel-uncore-freq-dumper}}.
The measurement is repeated on the cross product of following settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Core frequency set to \SI{800}{\MHz}, \SI{1600}{\MHz}, \SI{2000}{\MHz} and the default frequency range of \SI{800}{\MHz}--\SI{3800}{\MHz}.
    \item Uncore frequency set to \SI{800}{\MHz}, \SI{1600}{\MHz}, \SI{2500}{\MHz} and the default frequency range of \SI{800}{\MHz}--\SI{2500}{\MHz}.
\end{itemize}

Since the selected FIRESTARTER kernels do not produce peak power draw, I expect that the core frequency not throttled below the nominal frequency of \SI{2}{\GHz}.
This is the case, expect for the AVX512 and AMX frequency levels at \SI{800}{\MHz} core frequency, which are throttled to just above \SI{550}{\MHz}.
This effect is shown in~\figref{avx-anomalies-low-freq}.
The severity of the effect depends on the selected uncore frequency and is worsend with a higher frequency.
There is no obvious explaination of this behaviour.
\appref{avx-frequencies} contains the plots for the complete measurement matrix.

\begin{figure}[]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{fig/avx-frequency-license-bands-without-isst-core-frequency-800.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:avx-anomalies-low-freq}Average core frequency across the cores running the workload with the core frequency set to \SI{800}{\MHz}. For the AMX and AVX512 frequency levels core frequency throttling below \SI{800}{\MHz} occurs.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Uncore Frequency Selection}
\label{sec:avx-anomalies-uncore-freqency}

I ran the four described FIRESTARTER kernels \SI{100}{} times with ``Intel Speed Select'' disabled on CPU 0--7.
CPU 8 runs the uncore frequency measurement.
Hyperthreading is disabled and the CPUs used for the measurement are isolated from OS noise with a kernel parameter\footnote{isolcpus=0-8 nohz\_full=0-8}.
Each kernel is executed for \SI{20}{\s} discarding the first \SI{10}{\s} and last \SI{2}{\s}.
I expect the same performance and power draw across all runs.
However, two different levels of power draw with the kernels runnign at the AMX frequency level are visible in~\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-package-power-ecdf}.
This is caused by the uncore frequency selecting either \SI{1.4}{\GHz} for \SI{65}{\percent} and \SI{2.5}{\GHz} for \SI{35}{\percent} of the samples.
No major deviation of performance across the samples is observable, compare with~\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-mean-perf}.
\figref{avx-frequency-uncore-anomaly-max-ee} show the resulting suboptimal energy efficiency reduction of more than \SI{25}{\percent} for the samples which caused a selection of the higher uncore frequency.
The SSE frequency license also shows a reduction in energy efficiency for some samples, I could however not find a specific effect causing this change with the metrics I measured.

\section{Intel speed select}
\label{sec:isst}
With Ice Lake-SP~\cite{Intel_2020_IceLake_SP} Intel introducted Speed Select Technology (ISST) which offers four new power management mechanisms allowing to reconfigure the processor for different workloads.
ISST Performance Profile allows to reconfigure a single SKU with different core count and frequency configurations, increasing the processors flexibility for different applications.
ISST Base Frequency allows splitting the cores into a high and low priority group.
The base frequency of these groups is adjusted to be above and below the nominal frequency, respectively.
ISST Turbo Frequency allows splitting the the cores into a high and low priority group.
The high priority cores can maintain a high turbo frequency while the low priority cores are clipped to a lower turbo frequency.
ISST Core Power allows to assign cores to four different priority classes (CLOS).
Under a power constrained scenario cores can be either throttled based on their priority or each core can get a minimum frequency assigned while the remaining power is split up based on the priority and a weight.
The control mechanism of Core Power is described by a patent~\cite[pages~87-111]{Intel_2021_HPM}.
For the specifics of configuring Intel Speed Select I refer to the linux kernel documentation~\cite{Kernel_IntelSpeedSelect}.

As described in~\secref{avx-frequencies} the available turbo frequency limits are not influced by the Core Power CLOS.
To achieve high turbo frequencies for priority cores ISST Turbo Frequency has to be configured, otherwise low priority cores can negatively influence the maximal turbo frequencies even if the power budget is not exhausted.

\section{P-State Latencies}
\label{sec:pstate_latencies}

Core frequency changes can be used to optimize the energy consumption of a running process.
This requires the core voltage to be adjusted maintaining a save operating point.
To measure the latencies of such changes of a core, I adapt ftalat, a benchmark developed by Mazouz et al.~\cite{Mazouz_2014_ftalat} with modifications by Hackenberg et al.~\cite{Hackenberg_2015_Haswell}.

The ftalat bechmark measures the execution time of a compute loop with different processor frequencies.
It works as follows:
First, a frequency change from the source to the target frequency is requested using the sysfs interface.
Second, the execution speed of a compute loop is measured repeatidly until it matches the speed that is expected for the requested frequency.
The frequency is switched back and a random time between \SI{0}{\us} and \SI{20000}{\us} is waited before being repeated for a total \SI{4000}{} times.

In~\cite{Schoene_2024_Alder_Lake}, Sch√∂ne et al. demonstrated that the transition latencies of Alder Lake processors depend on the time since the last frequency transition, the transition from the target to the source frequency.
I split the measurement data at a interval of \SI{1}{\ms} since the last frequency transition and plot the median latencies in~\figref{pstate_latencies_median}.
Below this interval the behaviour is the same as in Skylake-SP~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} with a higher median latency of \SI{600}{\us} instead of \SI{500}{\us}.
Above this interval we see a different behaviour when switching to a frequency above \SI{1.8}{\GHz}.
Median latencies are higher in this area and they are not constant across different frequency changes.
To remove the measurement outliers I chosse to display the 95th percentile of transition latencies for all frequency changes in~\figref{pstate_latencies_95percentQuantile}.
Worst case transtion latency are in the range of \SI{1100}{\us} and \SI{2000}{\us} depending on the specific frequency change.

To investigate the specifics of the different transition latencies, I plot all the measured transition latency against the time between detection of last frequency change from source to target frequency.
\figref{pstate_latencies_time_dependance} show this for the frequency transitions from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.8}{\GHz}, \SI{1.9}{\GHz}, ..., \SI{2.9}{\GHz}.
\appref{pstate_latencies_scatter_complete} contains the plots for all measured frequency transitions.
The frequency transition from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.8}{\GHz} do not display any dependency between the latency and wait time between the transtion as expected from previous server processor generations.
This is consitent with testing performed on a Skylake-SP system.
For frequency transitions from \SI{1.2}{\GHz} to \SI{1.9}{\GHz} and above two regions are visible.
The first region with a time between detection of last frequency change from source to target frequency up to around \SI{2000}{\us} does not show a time dependency on the transition latency.
After this time a repeating pattern with a period of \SI{1625}{\us} is visible.
It intern contains samples which are not spread across the x-axis as previous, but are aligned with a period of \SI{200}{\us}.
Interestingly the number of samples which are above a transition latency of around \SI{900}{\us} transition latency decreases with an increased frequency change.
Furthermore, most samples do not align on a specific transition latency but are spread across a region of \SI{200}{\us}.

The mechanisms of changing core frequencies as described by Sch√∂ne et al. is not applicable~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} for the regions that emit this time dependent behaviour.
The power management seems to have an additional mechanisms that requies a frequency changes to above \SI{1.8}{\GHz} be finished at or before \SI{200}{\us}.
If this is not possible that would result in another penaly of \SI{200}{\us}.
This could be linked to a power management mechanism that has to increase the voltage for the specific core which could be bound to such period.
ftalat does not measure the time of how long the core is stopping its execution for the frequency change.
Intel~\cite{Intel_2020_IceLake_SP} removed this block time with the introduction of Sapphire Rapids' predecessor Ice Lake-SP.

\end{figure}

\section{Uncore Frequency Scaling}
\label{sec:uncore_frequency_scaling}
Sch√∂ne et al.~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} extended the methodology of ftalat to measure the time until a uncore frequency change is executed.
A pointer chasing benchmark is executed on a array that does not fit in the L1 or L2 cache and therefore resides in the L3 cache.
It is allocated using transparent hugepages.
First the uncore frequency is set to the source frequency using the \textbf{UNCORE\_RATIO\_LIMIT} model specific register.
The pointer chaser executed for \SI{50000}{} plus a random number of up to \SI{800000}{} iterations.
Then the frequency is switched to the target frequency.
The pointer chaser is executed for another \SI{50000}{} times.
If in this time any of the loads from the pointer chasing array blocks for more than \SI{0.5}{\us} the time until this event is saved.
The measurement is repeated \SI{1000}{} times for all frequency pairs.
The time until the frequency change is complete is not measured.
This is a limitation of this benchmark compared to ftalat for core frequency transitions.

The random time before executing the frequency change did not have an influence on the frequency change latency.
\figref{ufs_init_median} show a median change latency of \SI{}{\us} for all frequency transitions.
The worst case latency until this frequency change is \SI{}{\us} as shown in~\figref{ufs_init_95}.
\todoms{insert the correct us times here}
The uncore is blocked up to \SI{8}{us} as shown in~\figref{ufs_gap_95}.
Intel~\cite{Intel_2020_IceLake_SP} claims a block time of \SI{7}{\us} for Sapphire Rapids' predecessor Ice Lake-SP.
It is an improvement compared to Skylake where Sch√∂ne et al. measured \SI{15}{\us}.

\section{Idle State Latencies}
\label{sec:idle_state_latencies}

Idle state allow a processor to lower its power consumption by switching off different components and flushing caches on a per core or package basis.
Sapphire Rapids cores support the C0 (POLL), C1, C1E and C6 idle states.
They each have a lower power consumption but also a higher exit latency.
If all cores on a package are in C6 and therefore their L1/L2 cache is flushed, the complete package can go into a package idle states.
Sapphire Rapids support PC2 and PC6, though the later is disabled.
\todoms{check by reading MSR\_PKG\_CST\_CONFIG\_CONTROL}

Ilsche et al.~\cite{Ilsche_2018_cstate} presented a methodology to measure the exit latency of core returning from idle states.
A caller sends a pthread\_cond\_signal to a callee waiting for the signal using pthread\_cond\_wait.
The difference between the linux kernel events sched:sched\_waking on the caller and power:cpu\_idle on the callee is measured to determine the exit latency.
This is repeated for \SI{1000}{} times.
The caller is placed on CPU1 on the first socket.
CPU3 runs a while true loop to prevent the first socket from going into a package c-state.
I perform three different measurements.
First the callee placed on the first socket on CPU2.
Second the callee placed on the second socket on CPU57 and a while true loop to prevent package cstate on CPU58.
Third the callee placed on the second socket on CPU57 without an additional while true loop.
To remove OS noise from the measurement the used CPUs and the second package are isolated with a kernel parameter\footnote{isolcpus=1,2,3,56-111,168-223 nohz\_full=1,2,3,56-111,168-223}.

\figref{c6_latencies} show a box plot of the exit latency from the C6 idle state.
Outliers are marked in the plot.
The exit latency shows little difference with different core frequencies.
They are more than double of what Sch√∂ne et al.~\cite{Schoene_2019_SKL} measured for Skylake.
All latencies on the local socket and the active remote socket are below the limit of \SI{190}{\us} as advertised by Intel for Sapphire Rapids.
When the remote socket is idle the wakeup latency is increased by a constant of around \SI{25}{\us}
It is far below the limit of \SI{290}{\us} of PC6, as PC2 is used instead.
